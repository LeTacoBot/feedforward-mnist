# feedforward-mnist
A feedforward neural network built to parse the MNIST data set


Current Goals:

Upload training MNIST data -> the images are 45mb approximately, and that is too much for browser upload to handle.

Add biases! -> there are currently no biases implemented in the code

Change squashing function -> sigmoid is old and clunky, maybe implement relu or something a bit more funky?

Make UI better -> i might move on to a different project before that happens
